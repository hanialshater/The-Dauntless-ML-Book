    "In many real world situations we face well known problems like schedualing setofconflictingtasks orfindingshortestpaths.Althoughweknowmuchabouttheseproblemsandhavegoodalgorithms to solve them, we often run into the furstrating case of not having full info needed to run the algorithm. For example, we may know the tasks we want to schedual but do not know who much time each task will take. This section, will intorduce you to algorithms that will help you run your favorite algorithm to solve problems you are not 100% cetain about. To build intution, we will use task schedualing as a running example. We will start with a simple educational version of the problem and graudally add some complexity that you may face in real world schenarios. At the end, we will reach a duantless algorithm that will enable you to solve complex problems that you are not even certain about. With no further do lets get started!\n"
